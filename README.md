Repo for Flappy Canary Android App

You can find Flappy Canary here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kritikalerror.FlappyCanary

This app is based on a tutorial from Kilobolt Studios, which you can find here: http://www.kilobolt.com/zombie-bird-tutorial-flappy-bird-remake.html
It was really helpful going through it as a first time game developer. I never knew this much code went into one game, even with the libgdx engine supporting it

Flappy Canary 1.0 is just the game complete with achievements and leaderboards.
